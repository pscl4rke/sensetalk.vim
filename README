This contains a very small syntax highlighting file for Vim users who
are editing sensetalk files.

It does not follow many of the conventions for version handling, and it
is missing most of the keywords.

You might be able to install it using something like pathogen.
Otherwise just copy syntax/sensetalk.vim into ~/.vim/syntax.

Because autodetection doesn't work you'll have to add a mode line into
the files that you edit:

    (* vim:ft=sensetalk:
    *)

It is a work in progress.  Help out if you find it useful.
